Residents of early Singapore sought respite from the bustle of city life as well as tropical heat. Being an island, Singapore’s close proximity to the sea gave rise to several spots where people could enjoy sea views and cool breezes. The Esplanade in the city centre and Tanjong Katong on the east coast were popular seaside attractions since the 19th century. As the city developed, public parks and recreational spaces were established for the people. The Botanical Gardens, the Impounding Reservoir (now MacRitchie Reservoir) and other parks provided a quiet retreat and breather from the hurried city life – a function they continue to serve today.

Laid out in the 1820s, the Esplanade referred to the extensive open field known as the Padang, and the shoreline that fronts the sea. The public space was used for military exercises, ceremonies and recreation. Apart from being a playing field for cricket and rugby, the Esplanade in the 19th Century was also a hub for social life where people would gather for leisure, enjoy their evening strolls or rides in open horse-drawn carriages.

An iconic landmark, older Singaporeans remember Esplanade as a breezy recreational space and food hawkers such as Satay Club that used to be located there.

Founded in 1859, the Botanical Gardens (now Botanic Gardens) was intended for scientific research, ornamental and recreational use. Since the late 19th century, it has been a popular attraction in Singapore. The Botanic Gardens was conferred the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2015.

The Gardens introduced the Para Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plant, which brought about great prosperity to the Southeast Asian region with rubber trade during the early 20th century. It also became a powerhouse for orchid hybridisation research which put Singapore as one of the world’s leading orchids exporter.

The Impounding Reservoir was Singapore's first water supply system built in 1867 to meet the demand for fresh water supply. It started out as a small lake in the heart of the jungle, and was later enlarged and renamed MacRitche Reservoir in 1922, after James MacRitche, the Municipal Engineer of Singapore from 1883 to 1895. The reservoir was regarded as one of the prettiest spots on the island, and a pleasure for the tourists to take a leisure stroll at.

Also known as the Impounding Reservoir, and later MacRitchie Reservoir, it was constructed through a generous donation by Chinese philanthropist, Tan Kim Seng, in 1857. The water intake tower and connecting bridge was a reflection of late 19th century technology and construction method, and has been identified as one of the landmarks to be conserved.

Opened in 1929, the Alkaff Lake Gardens was a Japanese-style garden developed by the Alkaffs, a wealthy Arab family. As the first Japanese garden in Singapore, the Alkaff Gardens became a place of attraction for both residents and tourists, with its beautiful setting of a lake for rowing boats, landscaped paths, rentable tea houses, and picnic tables under shady trees.

In the 1820s, Tanjong Katong, the coastal area on eastern Singapore, was part of the land set aside by Raffles to be developed into a marine yard. By the 1860s, boat yards were proliferating there, which gave rise to related businesses such as boathouses and beachside resorts. Tanjong Katong became well-known for sea bathing, and numerous holiday villas were built by wealthy residents. The idyllic coconut groves and beach settings provided a quiet retreat from the bustling city life.

Tanjong Katong was an early landmark in Singapore. It used to be known for its boathouses and beachside retreats. The local folk song, “Di-Tanjong Katong”, sings of the tranquil atmosphere of Tanjong Katong with blue sea waters washing ashore.
