# **The Earliest Thoroughfares**
**Singapore’s development into a major port has been closely linked to its strategic geographical location and natural deep-water harbour. With the establishment of Singapore as a trading port in 1819, the mouth of the Singapore River functioned as a harbour at which ships called. Thus, the city’s earliest thoroughfare developed around this area, with Collyer Quay and the north banks of the river being the first business and civic centre. The first streets such as High Street, North Bridge Road and South Bridge Road were laid out here.  This section features selected scenes and landmarks of the historic city centre.**

Constructed in 1856, Johnston’s Pier was where most visitors first set foot on Singapore in her early days. Made of iron and wood, the pier had a 40-feet-wide platform which extended from shore into the sea. A red lamp used to hang at the end of the pier to warn ships as they entered the harbour, giving the pier its local name, ‘the red lamp’. It was demolished in 1935, replaced by nearby Clifford Pier which opened on 1933 to handle the increase in shipping traffic.

This view of Collyer Quay from Johnston's Pier shows the Singapore waterfront, which would have been many visitors’ first impressions of old Singapore. Collyer Quay was a street and seawall constructed in the 1860s. Lined with the offices of leading commercial firms, the quay served as a landing point for the unloading and storage of goods. The sampans in the foreground would bring goods from ships to warehouses along the Singapore River and passengers to Johnston’s pier.

Major commercial buildings occupied the waterfront at Collyer Quay. Seen here is the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation building (centre), right across the Johnston’s Pier. The magnificent building was completed in 1892 and demolished in the 1920s to make way for a new building. The site remains the location of the bank’s headquarters in Singapore.

By the 1930s, many commercial buildings along Collyer Quay had been replaced by modern ones. Seen from left are Union Building, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank building and Fullerton Building.
