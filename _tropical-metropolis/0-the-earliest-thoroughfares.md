# **Tropical Metropolis**
Singapore’s development into a major port has been closely linked to its strategic geographical location and natural deep-water harbour. With the establishment of Singapore as a trading port in 1819, the mouth of the Singapore River functioned as a harbour at which ships called. Thus, the city’s earliest thoroughfare developed around this area, with Collyer Quay and the north banks of the river being the first business and civic centre. The first streets such as High Street, North Bridge Road and South Bridge Road were laid out here.  This section features selected scenes and landmarks of the historic city centre.

Constructed in 1856, Johnston’s Pier was where most visitors first set foot on Singapore in her early days. Made of iron and wood, the pier had a 40-feet-wide platform which extended from shore into the sea. A red lamp used to hang at the end of the pier to warn ships as they entered the harbour, giving the pier its local name, ‘the red lamp’. It was demolished in 1935, replaced by nearby Clifford Pier which opened on 1933 to handle the increase in shipping traffic.
