As a port city on the major trade routes between Europe, India, Australia and China, early Singapore had long been exposed to cosmopolitan lifestyles and material culture. When the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 brought an influx of tourists from Europe to Singapore, accommodation, retail and entertainment facilities flourished to cater for the needs of the international traveller. This section showcases what Singapore had to offer when high living was called for â€“ from world-class hotels, modern department stores, shopping belts, as well as entertainment facilities to suit every taste and budget.
