As a port city on the major trade routes between Europe, India, Australia and China, early Singapore had long been exposed to cosmopolitan lifestyles and material culture. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 brought an influx of tourists from Europe to Singapore, and accommodation, retail and entertainment facilities flourished to cater for the needs of international travellers. This section showcases what Singapore had to offer when high living was called for – world-class hotels, modern department stores, shopping belts, as well as entertainment to suit every taste and budget.

Raffles Hotel was established in 1887 by Armenian hoteliers the Sarkies brothers and commenced operations as a 10-room hotel. Its seafront location made it popular among European residents and travellers. Its new main building, which opened in 1899, was among the first in Singapore to have electric lighting and appliances. By the early 1900s, it had transformed into one of the largest grand hotels in Asia, renowned for its modern amenities and luxury.

Raffles Hotel was renowned for parties and banquets at its ballroom, where guests could enjoy fine dining and dance to music performed by a live band.

English writer Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936), who visited Singapore in 1889, once said ‘feed at Raffles and sleep at the Hotel de l’Europe’, referring to the two leading hotels in the city then. Hotel de l’Europe began in 1857 as a modest establishment. It was renamed Grand Hotel de l’Europe in 1907, after a major refurbishment. During its heyday, it rivalled the Raffles Hotel in terms of luxury and service. The hotel closed in 1932.

Jewish businessman Nissim Nassim Adis bought the Hotel de l’Europe in 1906 and rebuilt it at a cost of one million Straits dollar. The rebuilt Grand Hotel de l’Europe was one of the most luxurious in Singapore, if not Asia, in the early 20th century. British novelist and biographer Horace Bleackley visited the Hotel in 1925 and claimed its grill room was ‘the best restaurant probably in the continent of Asia’.

Founded in 1842, John Little was Singapore's oldest department store. Often advertised as ‘the finest store East of Suez’, it had departments for wines and spirits, provisions, home furnishing, watches and clocks, books and stationery, arms and ammunition, ladies and gentlemen’s outfitting, and more. Besides offering European merchandise, John Little also ran a car business, motor garage, furniture factory, café and beauty salon.

Capitol Theatre, which opened in 1930, was regarded as one of the finest cinemas of its time. Covering more than 2,100 m<sup>2</sup>, its design drew inspiration from New York’s Roxy Theatre, and followed its seating arrangements, lighting and general plan. At its opening, the theatre’s auditorium was hailed as the most modern and largest in Asia.

Great World was one of Singapore’s major amusement parks that livened up the public’s leisure time in the 1950s and 1960s. The amusement park was developed in the 1930s to provide entertainment for low-income families. Apart from games and rides, visitors could watch films and Chinese operas, as well as wrestling and boxing matches.
