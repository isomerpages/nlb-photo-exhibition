As a port city on the major trade routes between Europe, India, Australia and China, early Singapore had long been exposed to cosmopolitan lifestyles and material culture. When the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 brought an influx of tourists from Europe to Singapore, accommodation, retail and entertainment facilities flourished to cater for the needs of the international traveller. This section showcases what Singapore had to offer when high living was called for – from world-class hotels, modern department stores, shopping belts, as well as entertainment facilities to suit every taste and budget.

Raffles Hotel was established in 1887 by Armenian hoteliers, Sarkies brothers, and commenced operations as a 10-room hotel. Its seafront location made it very popular with European residents and travellers. When its new main building opened in 1899, it was among the earliest buildings in Singapore to have electric lighting and appliances. By the early 1900s, it had transformed into one of the largest grand hotels in Asia, renowned for its modern amenities and luxury.

Raffles Hotel was renowned for parties and banquets at its Ballroom, where guests could enjoy fine dining and dance to music performed by a live band. Menu cards from the 1910s showed that the dishes served included clear turtle soup, baked fish in butter gravy, grilled fillet steak, and roasted pheasant. In the 1930s, after-dinner dances took place at the Ballroom till midnight from Monday to Saturday.

English writer Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936), who visited Singapore in 1889, once said ‘feed at Raffles and sleep at the Hotel de l’Europe’, referring to the two leading hotels in the city then. Hotel de l’Europe began in 1857 as a modest establishment. It was renamed Grand Hotel de l’Europe in 1907, after a major redevelopment. During its heyday, it rivalled the Raffles Hotel in terms of luxury and service. The hotel closed in 1932.

Jewish businessman Nissim Nassim Adis bought over the Hotel de l’Europe in 1906 and rebuilt it at a cost of one million dollars. The rebuilt Grand Hotel de l’Europe was one of the best in Singapore, if not Asia, in the early 20th century. British novelist and biographer Horace Bleackley visited the Hotel in 1925, and claimed that its grill room was ‘the best restaurant probably in the continent of Asia’.

Founded in 1842, John Little was Singapore's oldest department store. Often advertised as ‘the finest store East of Suez’, it had departments for wines and spirits, provisions, home furnishing, watches and clocks, books and stationery, arms and ammunition, ladies and gentlemen’s outfitting, etc. Besides offering European merchandise, John Little also ran a car business, a motor garage, a furniture factory, a café and a beauty salon.

From the turn of the century until the 1960s, High Street was a popular shopping street for highbrow products. Many Sindhi and Sikh merchants set up family-owned textile shops here, which were well-known for their imported European fabrics such as laces and brocade, and fine tailoring. This street continued to be Singapore’s premier shopping belt till the 1960s, with department stores such as Aurora, Chotirmall and Metro attracting shoppers for quality merchandise.

The Capitol Theatre, which opened in 1930, was regarded as one of the finest cinemas of its time. Spanning more than 2,100 square metres, the design of the theatre drew inspiration from the Roxy Theatre in New York, following its seating arrangements, lighting and general plan. At its opening, the theatre was hailed as having the most modern auditorium with the largest capacity in Asia.

The Great World was one of the major amusement parks that livened up the public’s leisure time in the 1950s and 1960s. The amusement park was developed in the 1930s to provide entertainment for low-income families. There were films and Chinese operas to watch, as well as wrestling and boxing matches.

The amusement parks were well-known for traditional opera performances of every description. People could watch Peking, Teochew and Cantonese operas, as well as Bangsawan (Malay opera). After the war, the park became popular once again, with carnival rides such as the Ghost Train, ferris wheel and carousel added to the suite of amusements for the crowd.
