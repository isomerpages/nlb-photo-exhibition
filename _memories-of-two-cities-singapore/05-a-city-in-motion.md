### **A City in Motion** 
Land transport in Singapore has come a long way since the arrival of the British colonisers in 1819. The earliest form of land transport in Singapore utilised manual labour and animals, such as the horse and carriage imported from England, and the bullock-cart which had been used in the Far East since the early days. The late 19<sup>th</sup> century saw the introduction of economical and convenient passenger transport via manual labour, which included the jinrikishas or rickshaws, which were imported from Japan, and the trishaw in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. 

With the second industrial revolution in the latter half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, came technological advancements which revolutionised land transport in the world, and such developments in the world found their way to Singapore quickly. Steam, electric and more importantly, motor vehicles and railways changed the way people moved from place to place. It gave birth to larger forms of public transport such as electric trams, trolley buses and trains. Motorised vehicles first arrived in 1896 and started to gain traction as private transport in Singapore from the 1920s onwards. Thus, at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, roads in Singapore were busy with bullock carts, horse carriages, trams, rickshaws, trishaws and motorised vehicles all sharing the main thoroughfares of town.
