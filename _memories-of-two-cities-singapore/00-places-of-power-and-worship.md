### **Places of Power and Worship** 
Singapore had appeared in different historical texts under different names, such as long ya men recorded in Dao Yi Zhi by Wang Dayuan during the Yuan dynasty (1349); and dan ma xi in Wu Bei Zhi compiled by Mao Yuanyi during the Ming dynasty (1621). Recent studies had also exhibited evidences that Singapore had been actively involved in maritime trade since the 14th century, with its natural deep harbour and strategic location. As such, neighbouring kingdoms had always coveted for Singapore, despite her being a small island. Before the second World War, Singapore had been governed by a number of rulers such as Parameswara, the Malacca Sultanate, the Johor Sultanate, and the Great Britain as a British colony. Traces of certain regimes still lingered on the island in the form of architecture built by these past rulers, which have now become historical landmarks attesting to the heritage of Singapore.

The colonial Singapore society was made up of a motley of ethnic and dialect groups from different nationalities, and each group brought along their religious beliefs as they set foot on this land. Places of worship built by different groups began to sprout in various parts of the town, symbolising the growth of each ethnic or religious community. These places of worship often included architectural features unique to the communityâ€™s identity and culture. Over the years, these places of worship have developed into social spaces where people gather for community activities, such as festival celebrations, marriages and cultural appreciation.
