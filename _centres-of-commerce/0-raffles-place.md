Originally known as Commercial Square, Raffles Place was designated as the business district of Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in
1822. It started as a swampy area and a hill had to be levelled in order to fill and construct the square. 

The proximity of Commercial Square to the harbour at Collyer Quay and the Singapore River, the lifeline of Singapore’s entrepôt trade, gave rise to financial houses, trading agencies, shops, godowns and offices around the Square. The imposing buildings of these commercial establishments lent an air of affluence and distinction to the area. 

Raffles Place and the surrounding areas have undergone tremendous changes over time. However, it remains the heart of Singapore’s financial district today.

Built in 1856, Collyer Quay was once the landing point for ships for the unloading and storage of goods, and disembarkation of passengers. Located next to Collyer Quay was Fullerton Square, a busy thoroughfare leading to the Commercial Square (later known as Raffles Place), the business hub of early Singapore. The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank is visible on the right.

Seen here is the Tan Kim Seng at Fullerton Square. Built in 1882 in the Victorian-style, it commemorated prominent merchant and philanthropist Tan Kim Seng’s contributions to the city’s waterworks. Leading away from the fountain is Battery Road which connected Collyer Quay to Commercial Square, making it one of the busiest streets in Singapore.

The mercantile community on Battery Road was made up of mainly European merchants and traders.  In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the street was lined with 3 and 4-storeyed buildings, housing shops, offices, warehouses and banks.

The Medical Hall, as seen on the left, had been a landmark at the corner of Fullerton Square and Battery road for many years. It was also known as the Red House due to its red-brick façade. Like many of the early dispensaries in Singapore, Medical Hall was started by European doctors, in this case, by German doctor Christopher Trebing in the 1870s. The building was demolished in 1970.

In the early 20th century, Raffles Place was a bustling commercial area with never-ceasing traffic, bordered by the imposing buildings of banks, offices and department stores. Seen here is the Chartered Bank Building in the centre and the façade of John Little on the right, the oldest department stores in Singapore.

The square of Raffles Place was once an open-air carpark. On the southern end is the Mercantile Bank building. On the right side stands the Raffles Chambers, with its distinctive statue of Eros that adorned its façade. Built in 1912 to house the retail store of Katz Brothers, it would go on to become the home of leading local department store, Robinsons & Co., who moved into the building in 1941.

The open-air carpark was transformed into a park by 1965, following the completion of an underground carpark. Named Raffles Place Park, it featured fountains and a giant flower clock. The tall building on the right behind the square is Bank of China, the tallest building in the area from 1954 to 1974. The underground carpark was demolished in the 1980s, to make way for the Raffles Place underground train station.
