Singapore’s role in regional trade dates back to the 13th century, when it was known as Temasek – one of the port cities along the Straits of Melaka, serving as an entrepôt for goods from Southeast Asia, China and India. In 1819, the British established a trading post in Singapore, primarily for her strategic location on major maritime trade routes and naturally deep harbours. 

The Singapore River, located within the Island’s central region, had been critical to the island’s development. For much of the 19th century, the River bustled with economic activity, with smaller vessels ferrying cargo between the riverbanks and ships docked at the harbour. When the river became over congested by the mid-1800s, the creation of a port at New Harbour (Keppel Harbour), drew some shipping activity away from the river. 

Today, the Singapore River is a popular spot for recreation and sightseeing, with many heritage sites in its vicinity.

Being the focal point of trading activities, the Singapore River was of great importance in the development of early Singapore as an entrepot port. The city’s shipping and trading activities were mostly concentrated at the mouth of the river and along Boat Quay. The river was bustling with bumboats and sampans ferrying, loading and unloading goods for import and re-export. Offices, shops, godowns and merchant houses were set up along the river.

_Twakows_ were bumboats used for transporting supplies and goods from anchored ships to shore and vice versa. Bumboats along the Singapore River were operated mainly by the Indians until the 1900s, when the Chinese, especially Hokkiens and Teochews, began to dominate the trade, calling the bumboats _twakows_ in their dialects.

Boat Quay, located on the southern bank of the Singapore River, was one of the first commercial areas developed in Singapore. As early as 1823, offices, shops, godowns and jetties were built along its banks and were run by European and Chinese merchants. By the 1860s, many European businesses moved to the New Harbour (Keppel Harbour) area, leaving Boat Quay a predominantly Chinese domain.

Located further upstream along the Singapore River from Boat Quay, Clarke Quay was also used as a dock for the loading and unloading of cargo for the godowns and commercial houses along the river. Two and three-storey shophouses were typical buildings at the quays, with the upper floors used as living quarters, and the ground floor units for shops and trading offices.

Godowns, or warehouses were important infrastructure of Singapore’s entrepot trade for the storage of goods. Most godowns were located along the Singapore River to receive goods ferried from cargo ships docked along the straits. Besides warehouses, some merchants also built their homes along the river with private jetties for loading and unloading of goods.
