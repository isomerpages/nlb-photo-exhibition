Up until the latter part of the 19th century, most of Singapore’s shipping activity was centred solely around the mouth of the Singapore River. However, by the 1850s, the river was congested with shipping traffic, and it became necessary to seek out a new port to cater to the demands of increasing trade in the area. 

New Harbour, now known as Keppel Harbour, had been in use by local and regional traders for centuries, but had been largely forgotten until 1848, when Henry Keppel, a British Royal Navy officer,  conducted a survey of the harbour, and recommended its use to both public and private shipping companies. Wharves were constructed at Tanjong Pagar, leading to the birth of New Harbour. This led to the rapid urbanisation of Tanjong Pagar as godowns, roads, and commercial and housing properties sprung up in the area along with growing economic activity around the harbour.

Keppel Harbour remains a mainstay of shipping activity in Singapore today.

In the first half of the 19th century, the mouth of the Singapore River functioned as a harbour where ships would call. However, the Singapore River estuary was too small and shallow to develop into a major port. By the 1850s, the river had become increasingly congested, and there was a need for a bigger port to cater to expanding port activities. The natural deep harbour at nearby Tanjong Pagar was surveyed in 1848, and wharves were built by shipping firms in the area, eventually leading to the birth of the port at New Harbour.

In 1852, the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O) opened a wharf at New Harbour, as seen in this picture. The wharf was ideal for ocean shipping, while the Singapore River continued to be used for coastal boats. Soon after, other wharves, warehouses, and coal stores opened up in the area, turning New Harbour into a bustling port. The harbour was renamed Keppel Harbour in 1900 after Henry Keppel, who surveyed the harbour in 1848 and recommended it as an alternative shipping site.

In 1864, Tanjong Pagar Dock Company was formed to construct a dry dock at the New Harbour. Opened in 1868, the dock was named Victoria Dock. Shipping traffic increased quickly with greater availability of wharves as well as more steamship services through Singapore. To meet the growing demand, the company built another dock named Albert Dock in 1879, which is partially visible in the background on the left.

By 1899, the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company owned the entire wharf frontage of New Harbour, controlling almost the entire shipping business in Singapore. The Harbour would later come under the management of the colonial government when the Singapore Harbour Board took over the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company in 1912. The Harbour Board eventually became the Port of Singapore Authority.

Built in 1892, the Boustead Institute was a hostel for merchant seamen and a landmark in Tanjong Pagar. It was named after English merchant Sir Edward Boustead, who founded the successful trading firm Boustead & Co. in Singapore in 1828. Boustead was concerned for the plight of seamen and bequeathed a sum of money upon his death to finance the construction of the Institute. The building stood at the junction of Anson Road and Tanjong Pagar Road, until it was demolished in the 1970s.
