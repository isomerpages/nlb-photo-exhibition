Up until the latter part of the 19th century, most of Singaporeâ€™s shipping activity was centred solely around the mouth of the Singapore River. However, by the 1850s, the river was congested with shipping traffic, and it became necessary to seek out a new port to cater to the demands of increasing trade in the area. 

New Harbour, now known as Keppel Harbour, had been in use by local and regional traders for centuries, but had been largely forgotten until 1848, when Henry Keppel, a British Royal Navy officer,  conducted a survey of the harbour, and recommended its use to both public and private shipping companies. Wharves were constructed at Tanjong Pagar, leading to the birth of New Harbour. This led to the rapid urbanisation of Tanjong Pagar as godowns, roads, and commercial and housing properties sprung up in the area along with growing economic activity around the harbour.

Keppel Harbour remains a mainstay of shipping activity in Singapore today.

In the first half of the 19th century, the mouth of the Singapore River functioned as a harbour where ships would call. However, the Singapore River estuary was too small and shallow to develop into a major port. By the 1850s, the river had become increasingly congested, and there was a need for a bigger port to cater to expanding port activities. The natural deep harbour at nearby Tanjong Pagar was surveyed in 1848, and wharves were built by shipping firms in the area, eventually leading to the birth of the port at New Harbour.
