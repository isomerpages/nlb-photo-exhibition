The colonial Singapore was a society made up of different ethnic groups, most of whom were immigrants hoping to pursue a better life here. The immigrants brought along their respective religious beliefs with them, so as to pray to the deities for comfort, hope and strength, which were important elements for those struggling to survive in a foreign land, while providing for their families back in their hometown.

In this section, a selection of places of worship will be presented. Given the multi-ethnic fabric of colonial Singapore, major religions of the world were being represented here. Some of these places of worship began as modest structures where travellers would go to give thanks for a smooth journey upon reaching Singapore, while others have been gazetted to be preserved as national monuments today. Many of these places featured unique architectural designs to reflect the community’s identity, culture and heritage, and have developed over time to become social centres for community activities.

The temple was built sometime between 1819 and 1822 by some of the earliest Chinese immigrants. The shrine was used for sea travellers to pray or give thanks for a safe journey between China and Singapore. The present building was built between 1839 and 1842 with funding from the Hokkien community and support of wealthy patrons. The temple is one of the oldest and most important Hokkien and Fujian temple in Singapore.

In 1907, Emperor Guang Xu of Qing Dynasty presented a plague and a silk scroll to the temple. The plague was inscribed with the Chinese characters 波靖南溟 (bo jing nan ming), which meant “gentle waves over the South Seas”, and was hung over the temple’s main altar until 1999.

Built between 1824 and 1826, the original mosque was a brick structure with double tiered roof in the shape of a pyramid built by Sultan Hussein Shah, whom Raffles installed as Sultan of Singapore. In the early 20th century, decisions were made to erect a new mosque because the old one needed substantial repairs, and hence a new building was completed in 1928. Today the Mosque is the largest in Singapore, and is supported by Muslims of all communities.

The original church was completed in 1836, however it’s spire was struck twice by lightning, rendering the building to be unsafe and demolished eventually. A new church in the neo-gothic style was completed on the original site in 1864, and remains standing today.
