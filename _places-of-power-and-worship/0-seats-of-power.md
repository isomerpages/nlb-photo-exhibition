Contrary to the common belief that Singapore was a quiet fishing town before the 19th century, studies have shown that the history of Singapore could be traced back to at least the 14th century, where a flourishing trading settlement already existed. Strategically situated on maritime trade routes, Singapore was ruled by a number of rulers, including Parameswara, the Malacca Sultanate and Johor Sultanate, before the British arrived and made Singapore a trading post, followed by a colony in the 19th century.

While the Malay royalty continued to reside at lavish palaces in Singapore during the 19th century, the British also established their presence by building a Government House on Bukit Larangan (Forbidden Hill), which was exclusive to the royalty in the past. The Government House was the residence of colonial governors until the 1850s, where the House was demolished to construct an artillery fort, and the hill was renamed Fort Canning Hill, which remains an important landmark in Singapore today.

Fort Canning Hill, previously known as Bukit Larangan (Forbidden Hill) and Government Hill, has been a landmark in Singapore's earliest recorded history. A bungalow was built after Sir Stamford Raffles arrived in 1819, which became known as the Government House, and was the residence of subsequent colonial governors until the 1850s when the Fort was built. The entrance to Fort Canning consisted of a main gate with its distinctive Gothic archway located at the north side of the hill.
