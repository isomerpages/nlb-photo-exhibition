      title: Memories of Two Cities - Singapore
      description: Singapore has a long history that dates back more than 700 years
        ago. After the founding of a British trading post on the island in 1819,
        Singapore developed into a thriving entrepot characterised by cultural
        diversity. The Singapore component of the exhibition showcases 173
        photographs from the 1880s to the 1960s, mainly drawn from the
        collections of the National Library and the National Archives of
        Singapore.
