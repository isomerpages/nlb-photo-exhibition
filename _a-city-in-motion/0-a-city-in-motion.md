Rickshaws, also known as Jinrikishas or jinrickshas, were imported from Japan via Shanghai in the 1880s. It is a small lightweight cart with large wheel that is pulled by a single man. These hand-drawn carriages were a very popular means of transport being both cheap and convenient. Rickshaws were popular as they were ideal for short journeys through crowded inner-city streets and alleys. Commuters used it to get to work, social gatherings, school and shopping.

This is an image of a street in Chinatown, off South Bridge Road where most of the jinricksha pullers lived in tiny cubicles. Rickshaw pulling was a primary source of income for thousands of Chinese immigrants, majority of whom were illiterate peasants. Rickshaw-pulling was an easy means of earning a livelihood since it did not call for special skills. Henghua and Hockchew immigrants from south-eastern China dominated the rickshaw trade from the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.

Some of them had a second job as construction coolies to supplement their income.

The horse-drawn carriage was a common sight in Singapore in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. It was an English gentleman’s means of travel, an elite form of transportation for the upper classes, and it was the early equivalent of the private car too. Smaller carriages were later used for public hire, rather much like taxis today. These were called “hackneys” or “gharries”, which crowded the streets in the business area of town.
