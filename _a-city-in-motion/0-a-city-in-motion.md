Rickshaws, also known as Jinrikishas or jinrickshas, were imported from Japan via Shanghai in the 1880s. It is a small lightweight cart with large wheel that is pulled by a single man. These hand-drawn carriages were a very popular means of transport being both cheap and convenient. Rickshaws were popular as they were ideal for short journeys through crowded inner-city streets and alleys. Commuters used it to get to work, social gatherings, school and shopping.

This is an image of a street in Chinatown, off South Bridge Road where most of the jinricksha pullers lived in tiny cubicles. Rickshaw pulling was a primary source of income for thousands of Chinese immigrants, majority of whom were illiterate peasants. Rickshaw-pulling was an easy means of earning a livelihood since it did not call for special skills. Henghua and Hockchew immigrants from south-eastern China dominated the rickshaw trade from the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.

The horse-drawn carriage was a common sight in Singapore in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. It was an English gentleman’s means of travel, an elite form of transportation for the upper classes, and it was the early equivalent of the private car too. Smaller carriages were later used for public hire, rather much like taxis today. These were called “hackneys” or “gharries”, which crowded the streets in the business area of town.

The horse-drawn carriage was a common sight in Singapore in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. It is an English gentleman’s means of travel, and an elite form of transportation for the upper classes, it was also the early equivalent of the private car. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, it was considered fashionable to show off one’s smartly maintained horse and carriage by taking a turn around the Padang in the centre of town.

Bullock-drawn carts were one of the earliest and most popular mode of transport in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century Singapore. It was commonly used for the transportation of goods for short distances. It carried goods from the wharves to town and many bullock carts could be seen around the boat quays bringing goods from the ships. It was also used as a conservancy vehicle for the transport of refuse.

Another purpose of the bullock cart is to transport water. Kreta Ayer, which literally translates to “bullock cart water” in Malay, draws its name from the bullock and ox carts that used to ply the road carrying water for the early inhabitants of Singapore. They also transported water drawn from wells at Ann Siang Hill to Chinatown residents, and water the streets to keep the dust raised by vehicles down.

A fruit hawker, a rickshaw puller and a bullock cart were seen at the entrance of Teutonia Club in the foreground. Rickshaws and bullock carts were popular modes of transport frequently used by the early residents of Singapore. Bullock carts began to dwindle from 1867 with the introduction of mechanised transport, while rickshaws continued to be popular until they were slowly replaced by the trishaws, which were introduced in 1947.

Chinese bullock carts comprised of two wheels instead of four, and were drawn by water buffaloes with large palm leaves attached to them. They were a common sight in early Singapore too, as they not only carried passengers, but also vats of soy sauce and all kinds of liquids to be sold to kampong residents.

The trishaw was introduced during the Japanese occupation and it is a bicycle with a sidecar, powered by the cyclist. Compared to the rickshaw, it was a more efficient mode of transport. It was a popular choice of public transport in the 1940s and 1950s. By the late 1970s, trishaw riding was a dying service with most of the riders moving into tourism, and ferrying tourists to experience the yesteryears of Singapore.

Many of the early trishaw riders were Chinese immigrants belonging to the Henghua, Hokchia and Hokkien dialect groups, which originated from the Fujian province in China. They arrived mainly in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and went into the relatively new rickshaw industry. Most of them were fluent in more than one language and dialect, including English.
