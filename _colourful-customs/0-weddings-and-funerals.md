Rickshaws, also known as jinrikishas or jinrickshas, were imported from Japan via Shanghai in the 1880s. Consisting of a small lightweight cart with large wheels pulled by a single man, these carriages were a common means of transportation throughout the
19th and early 20th centuries. Rickshaws were popular as they were an inexpensive mode of transport, ideal for short journeys through crowded inner-city streets.
