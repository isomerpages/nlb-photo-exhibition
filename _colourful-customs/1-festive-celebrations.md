In early Singapore, people accorded great importance to the observance of customs during life events such as weddings and funerals. Often, these events involved elaborate practices and attracted spectators.  

Weddings were joyous occasions in which family, friends and even the whole neighbourhood partook. Colourful and elaborate processions were common. Likewise, processions were a part of funerals, even though they were sombre events. For the Chinese, the scale of these processions, often organised at great expense, reflected the wealth and social standing of the family. 

Rich in symbolism and meaning, rites of passage reinforced the traditional values or religious beliefs of the various communities. While most wedding and funeral customs in Singapore have simplified over time, some continue to be practised and are part of Singaporeans’ cultural identities.

Traditional Malay weddings were generally grand events with many guests held over several days. The highlight of the wedding is the _bersanding_, or sitting-in-state ceremony, where the bridal couple sits on a throne placed on a dias, and is treated as king and queen for the day. During the ceremony, friends, relatives and guests offer their blessings and congratulations.
