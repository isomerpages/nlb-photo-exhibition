The Raffles Library and Museum was opened to the public in 1887 and was a key attraction to visitors and residents of Singapore. While the Library comprised of a reference library, a lending library and a reading room; the Museum presented its rich collection in the ethnological, geological, mineralogical, zoological and botanical specimens. The building is now part of the National Museum of Singapore.
