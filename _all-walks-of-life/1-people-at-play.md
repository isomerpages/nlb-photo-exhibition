Along with the influx of different migrant communities came numerous forms of leisure in early Singapore. The Chinese brought their traditional operas in various dialects; the Malays and Indians each introduced their own theatres, music and dances. The Europeans also had their fair share of influence on the leisure scene in Singapore. Western past-times, such as horse racing and social dancing, were integrated into local social life and became popular leisure pursuits of the well-heeled Asians. Being a tropical island with dense forests, old Singapore offered opportunities for recreational swimming and beach-going, as well as sports hunting for the adventurous. All in all, multi-racial communities created a rich and diverse leisure culture which is evident in the photographs presented here.

Traditional dances were usually performed at festive events such as weddings, festivals and gatherings of the Malay community in Singapore. The dancers here perform the joget, where men and women dance to fast-paced rhythm accompanied by violin, gong, flute and drums. The dance is believed to have drawn influences from the Portuguese folk dance, which spread to the Malay Archipelago during the 16th century.

The races were attended mostly by Europeans and Malay royalty, and later wealthy Chinese. The race was also a place to see and be seen, where affluent spectators, dressed in their finery, rub shoulders with one another.

Being a tropical island, it is no surprise that swimming and beach-going became a popular leisure activity in Singapore. To cater for recreation, hoteliers and wealthy families built seaside bungalows along Singapore’s scenic eastern coasts. These resorts often had bathing pagars, which is an area enclosed by fences extending from the shore to the sea for swimming.

Tigers were sighted in the forested areas of Singapore during the mid-18th and early 19th centuries. They became a menace when the forests were cleared for roads and plantations, frequently attacking humans. Due to the high casualties, the government offered monetary rewards for every tiger killed. Hence, tiger hunting became a rewarding sport offering money and adventure. Seen here are men of the Straits Hunting Party, a club formed by Straits Chinese, with their prey at Choa Chu Kang Village.
