Along with the influx of different migrant communities came numerous forms of leisure in early Singapore. The Chinese brought their traditional operas in various dialects; the Malays and Indians each introduced their own theatres, music and dances. The Europeans also had their fair share of influence on the leisure scene in Singapore. Western past-times, such as horse racing and social dancing, were integrated into local social life and became popular leisure pursuits of the well-heeled Asians. Being a tropical island with dense forests, old Singapore offered opportunities for recreational swimming and beach-going, as well as sports hunting for the adventurous. All in all, multi-racial communities created a rich and diverse leisure culture which is evident in the photographs presented here.

Chinese opera performed on the street was a popular form of entertainment in Singapore. Opera performances often would be staged outdoors on temple grounds during the celebration of deities’ birthdays and traditional festivals. The main forms of Chinese opera performed in Singapore were from the three largest Chinese dialect groups: Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese.
