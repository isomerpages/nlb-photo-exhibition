The founding of Singapore as a British trading port in 1819 led to an influx of immigrants from China, India and the Malay Archipelago, who came in search of work opportunities arising from the colony’s rapid growth. People of different trades and socio-economic status arrived, from administrators and merchants to peddlars and labourers.

A large number of migrants from China and India came here as labourers, providing the much needed labour in building construction and various industries on the island. Among the indigenous Malays and others from the region, many worked as fishermen and farmers. Regardless of race, many migrants also worked as itinerant hawkers plying their trade from street to street. The Europeans came as administrators as merchants, working in government offices, banks and trading houses. They were later joined by English-educated locals working under them. The following images show people at work who contributed to the development of early Singapore.

Many impoverished Chinese migrants came to Singapore in the 19th century to work as coolies – indentured labourers who were employed in construction, agriculture, shipping, mining and other sectors. They formed the backbone of early Singapore’s labour force. Mostly engaged in unskilled, hard labour, coolies worked as under harsh circumstances. Coolies carrying cargo and commodities around the Singapore River was a common sight in the old days.
